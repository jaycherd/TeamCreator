General info: 
* format of name_availability matrix is ( (name1,start,end,start,end,...), (name2, start,end,start,end,...))
* note also that timeStamp format is 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and date by default has a date of 1900-01-01
    * I programmed the TimeStamp to correspond to the days of the week, where Monday is 1900-01-01 and Sunday is 1900-01-07
